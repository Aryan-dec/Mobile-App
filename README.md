# FalixNodes Mobile Application
> This is not FalixCoins app

It's a quick way to access all FalixNodes from one area, much like FalixNodes Desktop. 

## FalixNodes App v2.0
The application is now being rewritten in React Native, which the developer (Korbs Studio) is still learning, thus issues are to be expected.
