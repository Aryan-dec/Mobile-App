As most apps here, it's just a webview embedding a website.

To change what website to embed, you need to change `webview.loadUrl("");` in __MainActivity.java__, you can find that [here](https://github.com/FalixNodes-Software/Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/korbsstudio/falixnodes/MainActivity.java#L18)

Then in the menu at the top of Android Studio, go to Build > Make Project then Build > Buid Bundle(s)/APK(s) > APK. Click locate to find APK file.

The application was built in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
