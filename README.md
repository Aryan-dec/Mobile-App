# FalixNodes Mobile Application
> This is not FalixCoins app

It's a quick way to access all FalixNodes from one area, much like FalixNodes Desktop. 

## FalixNodes App v2.0
The application is now being rewritten in React Native, which the developer (Korbs Studio) is still learning, thus issues are to be expected.

### Known Issues
#### iOS
 - Keyboard is white, even if system theme is set to dark
#### Android
 - If header is hidden, the content is overlapped with the system's status bar
 - The status bar color is black instead of white
 - There are no back buttons or any other controls for webviews
